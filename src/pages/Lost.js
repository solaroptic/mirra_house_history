        <h5>"The Storm"</h5>

          This was the initial design concept and it came before work started on
          it. Me and Rob are missing
        </aside>
        <br></br>
        <p>
          Most of the beats for "The Storm" were done by the end of 2004. The
          name came from the inner-conflict of the group (and hoping things
          would grow as a result), the cover of the '04 album and also
          reflecting the nature of the sound which had evolved further. It felt
          more electronic; yet with more piano and a faster tempo; all the
          result of no authentic guitar. It had sort of a weird
          danceable-but-slick-business-street sound to it. It still sounds
          futuristic to me as I think of the line-up.
        </p>
        <p>
          I was more firm in deciding to keep the sound consistent. Due to Rob's
          working with Sampson, I felt it would be easy to convince him to let
          me handle all of the beats on that one. I still wanted him to produce
          long-term, though, but I wanted to have a regular guitar player before
          we tried to merge our styles again. I wrote about half the hooks for
          it and maybe 1/3 of the lyrics to a rough track list which changed a
          lot besides the first eight I liked or so. It was a good time in music
          mode. Maybe the last time I was really able to focus on music for a
          year.
        </p>
        <p>
          Of course, "The Storm" never happened. Because of the risks associated
          with the more futuristic sound, I wanted Rob to write one level better
          than he did before, to match his performance and to ensure our
          success. I would work on my performance. I wanted him to find about
          half the hooks and keep trying till they were solid. I wanted the ends
          of verses feeling more solidly wrapped up than sounding hurried. He
          could do it....but at that moment in time, Rob seemed more like a
          creature in his natural environment with his new/former group. He was
          working with guys he'd known for over a decade; and they were able and
          ready to do shows. I didn't want to pressure Rob to write his songs
          during that time as I felt I would get a product below expectations.
        </p>
        <p>
          Much of it was watching my beats continue to change even after I had
          enough for the album. I also wondered the point; if we weren't able to
          get people together for a show as it was, how would it work going
          forward on an album I still felt wouldn't be our signature sound. I
          began to think of getting more rappers to participate. I didn't think
          Phil was ready for a 1/2 album of work either; so this meant meeting
          new people etc. This led to..."12 Miles On the Brazos."

        <h5>MH Parody/Satire EP</h5>
        <p>
          Late '06 and finished in early '07. Maybe 5 tracks. One of the most
          underrated and also most forgotten of all complete works. A small part
          of me has always wondered if this was the actual path for me. It was
          how I started. This is actually one of the most authentic works I've
          done; along with 2009's "7". "What You Know About" is also one of the
          greatest songs I've heard of anyone's music. "Lucky Charms" is also an
          all-timer.

        <p>
          Track List: Crack Song, Grandmother Hustlin'(lost), What You Know
          About, Knockin' Doors down, Lucky Charms and maybe one other lost
          track.

          "Showtyme" was a dramatic shift in direction for the house. Production
          finally became the center stage.
