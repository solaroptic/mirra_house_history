          The Origin Story...
        </h2>
        <br />
        <p>
          After a few random, uninspired attempts to make music going back to
          1996, I decided to try again in 2000, but a bit more serious. I really
          felt the beats more than vocals and usually only felt connected to rap
          lyrics when in a more angry or defiant mood (most of my teen years).
          The problem with actually recording a song was that instrumental beats
          were far easier (cheaper) to find (download) than they were to create.
          I could rap over them for free and my first recorded rhyme came over
          the instrumental section of Juvenile's 400 degrees in late '99.
        </p>
        <br />
        <p>
          Between work and school, music was generally something I just didn't
          have time for, but occasionally I'd write a song here or there and
          often they were parodies of other songs that only existed on pages of
          a notebook. I hated my voice and didn't record it after the 400
          degrees track for a couple years.
        </p>
        <br />
        <p>
          After hearing some Three 6 Mafia in 1998, I eventually stumbled upon a
          larger collection of their music my senior year in high school.
          Starting with "When The Smoke Clears" in mid 2000 and later, the
          equally impressive Gangsta Boo's "Enquiring Minds;" I was amazed at
          the production, consistency and arrangement of material.. Sonically,
          the landscape spoke my language; I was overwhelmed that someone would
          make beats so similar to the sounds of my mind. Lyrically, some things
          intersected well with teen anger, but I treated beats and lyrics very
          separate and would choose a different direction.

          Waco High was partly an institution for rap music (drugs and
          education, too).

          March 9, 2001 was the day I quit my slightly evil phone company job
          and decided to buy a cd in consolation. I heard the beats of "Tear Da
          Club Up Thugs" ('99) and it was immediately decided music was
          something to pursue as an alternate to the types of employment
          available. Without it, leaping off a tall building was looking more
          and more fascinating month-by-month I knew it would take awhile to
          understand what exactly it is I would do and how to do it; but that
          day was the shift, and possibly the birthday of Mirra House.
        </p>
        <br />
        <p>
          Around that week, little known Mark Haley of Waco High would enter the
          picture and get me a job at an unnamed fast-food job in the mall;
          simultaneously, he fronted me some cash for an audio recording program
          (Acid 2.0). Thanks, Mark.

          Tim's neighbor Rob (who we largely met by reason of weed in the shed
          between the two houses) was also into music and liked to free-style.
          Free-styling had become omni-present in late 1999's Waco, due to the
          dominance of the Screw-and-Watts-led Houston music scene.
        </p>
        <br />
        <p>
          I mostly made parodies of that Houston sound, being white and other
          things going on. Through my style of satire, I felt a little more
          comfortable proceding, I wasn't quite sure how serious the music I
          wanted to start making was presented. I knew it would take awhile to
          get "good," so I ran with rapping over instrumentals with friends and
          my brothers about random stuff and seeing what would stick.

          In early 2001, Kareem and the Texas Thugs (K.A.T.T.T.) was the name I
          gave the group we started. The name originated from a book report in
          September of my senior year extended into a joke/philosophical point
          of getting people to look at things from a different (Muslim) point of
          view. Me, Tim and Jamal took Muslim names (Kareem Azire Sharriff/
          Muhsin Abdul Sharriff/ Jamal something Sharriff) and used them at
          school. I had "Kareem" on my name-tag at work. It wasn't intended to
          be serious in tone, especially with a name like "KATTT," (meow). I
          did, however want to pursue it seriously. I had a few parody style
          songs written but was sure I wouldn't do it on my own.

          I probably should have. It would've gotten done and I would've gotten
          slightly more comfortable with my voice. Tim was not a rapper, but he
          was creative. I thought he would be amusing. Jamal loved freestyle and
          was heavy into the Houston sound. Plus, he was pretty connected. Even
          though my brothers were still junior high kids and had zero experience
          rapping, they were automatically involved, as much of this was a bunch
          of ideas and the want to make music colliding at their house. 3701
          Trice Avenue was technically the first studio we had, though it barely
          qualified.
        </p>
        <br />
        <p>
          Dyaa Izz and Fadl Nadir Sharriff ended up being more passionate about
          making the music than their more able older counterparts Tim and
          Jamal. Around this time, Tim began the rough road of his so-called
          "party-era." This led to him being more and more distant in multiple
          ways. Jamal was never really sold on the idea, so I decided to make a
          demo/intro track to show him we were serious. He would've given the
          group more credibility and audience because he was quite popular at a
          large high school. During the construction of our intro track "Project
          KATT," ( a sample of Salt & Peppa's "Push it" set over Gangsta Boo's
          "Don't Stand So Close" drums) I tried to get them vocalizing one bar
          at a time and I realized this would take awhile. A long while.
        </p>
        <br />
        <p>
          In the meantime, my mall job put me in a workplace with three other
          "rappers." It really was a phenomenon at the time. Locally known J.R.
          and random freestyler Jeremy were people I had actually known for a
          few years, but the third, Gilberto was a young unknown cat. He was
          from Brownsville and I often called him "Brownsville Gill." He
          preferred "Uno." His first language was Spanish and I thought that was
          useful and representative of our environment. When he learned of the
          temporary recording we were doing on Trice, he wanted to be involved.
        </p>
        <br />
        <p>
          Late 2001 into 2002, I started in junior college with no desire to be
          there. Frustrated with the never-ending complexities associated with
          music, and still working fast-food; I began hustling. Different things
          here and there to see what would catch. Primarily, though, I was
          thinking I needed better tools to record with and a new car. I had
          been experimenting with the software at my younger brother's house and
          found there was a very large gap between home recordings and
          professional.
        </p>
        <br />
        <p>
          The software I was using to record also made beats out of loops; but
          they weren't right for...really anything except techno. So, I picked
          up a $300 Yamaha board sometime in late 2001. This taught me some
          foundational concepts to making a beat and led me to realize I leaned
          towards making money selling beats. I would advertise through small
          demos.
        </p>
        <br />
        <p>
          I decided to involve Uno because I didn't really want to rap and he'd
          save me time. I recall an entire night into the morning recording the
          4 of us on Trice. The results then made me want to involve Rob. I
          found a bond with Rob through music, hustle and childish get-rich
          ideas. He had a music "family," but they didn't collaborate often and
          were more R&B oriented. I thought it was good practice for me to write
          with a group of guys who wrote on their own and I wouldn't need to
          help them as with my brothers. Trice wouldn't have really worked as a
          studio if I had decided to make a group. So we just wrote and pitched
          ideas later in the year, with large gaps in time here and there.
        </p>
        <br />
        <p>
          Rob had similar ideas about selling beats and we often traded the
          keyboard for weeks at a time to show each other what we could do. As a
          former church drummer, he had a happier, more percussive-focused vibe
          to his sound. The sounds I resonated with were usually darker or more
          melancholy and cinematicly focused. Many times I didn't even want a
          "dark" beat but that's just what I made. Combining with Rob sort of
          evened this out. Suddenly, it seemed possible to follow this path; if
          only I had slightly better tools...
        </p>
        <br />
        <p>
          This, plus Rob, Uno, 9/11 and lack of participation largely ended the
          Muslim-named group. Jamal never took it seriously, (which no one
          should have). I also began considering simply selling music itself as
          tracks for movies etc.

        <br></br>
        <p>
          In early 2002, I got a better job at a certain grocery store belonging
          to a state-wide chain. This delivered a more consistent paycheck and
          with other side hustles, the '95 Caprice entered the picture; which
          would later serve as the final test for all Mirra House recordings, as
          well as creative ideas. Work started producing results.
        </p>
        <br />
        <p>Now, about the part where I decide exactly what to do...</p>
        <br />
        <p>
          In a farm-setting, just outside of Waco, I was discussing the idea of
          a new music group together with my brothers at their temporary place,
          when a decision was made that had long been tapping on my shoulder,
          but I just wasn't ready to take a leap. The idea was not to rely on
          instrumental parodies and make a sound we could more believe in that
          would therefore be better to practice to. If the sound was silly, my
          brothers and I wouldn't take serious the need to improve our own vocal
          sounds, timing skills and ideas
        </p>
        <br />
        <p>
          While walking along the fence this same day, I really struggled who
          would make up the group. This would directly dictate the type of sound
          we'd have. I pictured a separation from the electrical nature of the
          keyboard and incorporation of live guitar similar to UGK. I imagined
          me and my brothers making the kind of music we want, when we want and
          me making money from statewide shows and selling beats. This would
          allow the music to be more personal; allowing me to synthesize my
          cinematicly aggressive sound (think three 6) and the place where my
          classic rock childhood met with a more twangy-bluesy sound (think
          UGK).

        <aside>Where the Mirra House idea originated...</aside>
        <br />
        <p>
          Mostly because Rob already halfway had a group, a different sound and
          was older; I wasn't sure about putting him in a group with my
          inexperienced brothers. This left Uno with us, which was a strange
          fit. Ol' Brownsville Gill had his style and things he wanted to
          express that likely would clash with the brothers and the longer goal.
        </p>
        <br />
        <p>
          The name came while under the light on Beverly and New Road (heading
          west) in the summer of '02. Likely June or July. The concept of the
          mirror gave us an open canvas to write upon whatever we seen or
          whatever we wanted to reflect on. No one actually pronounced "mirror"
          as "mirror," so that's the "Mirra," part. House was preferable to me
          because it was more informal and could include whoever hung out with
          us; which later paid-off. I hated the pretentious "Records," people
          liked to stick to the end of their name as if they'd formally set up
          lawyers, legal work, had a distribution deal and paid their artists
          checks. "Entertainment," implied you entertained people in multiple
          ways; like movies and video games. Nah...
        </p>
        <br />
        <p>
          Never really liked the name Mr. Mirra; it was intended as a
          placeholder because I was sure I'd find a better name. Just lazy...
          Oddly, Gary Green III had a poster of bmx rider Dave Mirra on his wall
          in our first full studio set up. Diyaa Izz became D-Mize (just sounded
          cool) and Fadl Nadir became N-Cydout (he was considered a
          black-sheep-type). I decided, for the time-being, to separate the two
          groups: One being the long-term project intended for two or more years
          of practice before viablility could be assessed. The second being me,
          Rob and Uno as separate, but collaborating entities.

          Later, by August, I had purchased the coveted $2,300 76-key Korg
          Triton. I really shouldn't have. I hadn't learned any form of the
          piano or any other instrument. It allowed a great leap in arrangement
          and construction that would hinder my advancement in general music
          theory. I never learned to hear notes, or play in real time. The
          Triton also represented a functional symbol of the three artists.

        <br />
        <p>
          August and September of 2002 were spent recording a Mirra House
          practice album called "Illegal Visions." The name came from the fact
          we were using other's (illegal) beats, but it was intended as
          something like work for the future "vision," but more specifically,
          each track would not exactly represent us and was a particular dream
          or "vision" somewhere between our favorite artists and ourselves. It
          was fun but often tedious. Writing almost all of the lyrics and
          rehearsing everyone on how to put each word on each beat was a serious
          task. It became even more tedious recording 2 or 4 bars at a time and
          saving it to an ancient floppy-disk on the Triton and placing it into
          the desktop for waveform alignment. Since only our friends were
          intended to hear it, a lot of time was saved by rushing the alignment
          process. It made us sound further off-beat than we already were due to
          inexperience and trying to rap with the release versions in our ears
          instead of the instrumentals.
        </p>
        <br />
        <p>
          The importance of the journey was probably not observed at the time. I
          remember constantly thinking of good lyrics and then thinking not to
          waste them on such a trivial project. There is a sort of priceless set
          of memories, however, of us writing in the sun in the country and
          recording in two different campers and a closet. Timing was a big
          issue and changed the way I thought about several parts of the
          process. Creativity was challenged by longer hours working and
          uncertainty of purpose. The material we developed was essentially,
          "Can you clone the sounds of the artists you listen to?"
        </p>
        <br />
        <p>
          We really didn't do a solid job, but the ideas were creative. We
          received compliments on this from local artists like Playa C and Lane.
          We decided to sell it to get more funding for equipment. I would later
          regret selling in this era as it would have been better publicity to
          handout; so maybe it was better we didn't because it definitely was an
          unfinished product intended for us to learn. It always sounded
          painfully awkward to me in context of others listening. N-Cydout
          jammed it for many years, though; I really think it was the growth and
          experience that led to it being considered such a sacred and important
          event.
        </p>
        <br />
        <p>
          This led to "The Bridge." It was more an internal idea that sort of
          happened. I don't really know if anyone remembers them as two separate
          groups, but after Illegal Visions, I decided to mix in Rob and Uno
          into the group. Firstly, it was because I loved the creative process
          that went with IV; I wanted to keep working on Mirra House stuff.
          Doing this separately with Uno and Rob would be too time-consuming and
          I was actually in my second year in college. Secondly, I would only
          have to write for and coach the brothers. D-Mize and N-Cydout could
          participate in smaller roles until they developed stronger work.{" "}

        <br />
        <p>
          The product was expected to be more solid than IV, but not quite as
          solid vocally as the other group. that would be fine, because I
          anticipated this to be at least a two year construction of a sellable
          product. It would also allow me to make the music more in my style,
          though Rob would take some of the load off beat-making by us splitting
          those duties. It would sacrifice a more specific style, but allow us
          more time overall.
        </p>
        <br />
        <p>
          I didn't feel like it would hold Rob back because of his other group,
          they had a song on the radio in Austin a couple years prior; but he
          could help the younger brothers. Rob had a unique voice that cut
          through a mix in an exciting way. When recording vocals, he put 100%
          into each bar. It often made up for any rushing of the writing
          process. He could also bring everyone together in a down moment. Him
          being older and more experienced helped us see things earlier on than
          we would have without him.
        </p>
        <br />
        <p>
          Uno had spirit. He was almost like our mascot early on. He had energy
          and passion for the music. He often got carried away in moments that
          made us laugh. Gill was also open to new ideas and easy to get along
          with; never had too big an ego. Him being a writer allowed me and Rob
          to focus on making beats early on.
        </p>
        <br />
        <p>
          The full studio set up would arrive by October. That reinforced
          production over music theory or lyrical advancement as well, as there
          was so much to learn about audio in such a short amount of time.
          Acoustics, treatment, mic selection and placement, phantom power,
          compression, EQ, mixing, summing, limiting, reverb, routing signals,
          headroom gradually took over my focus and generally take years to
          master. No one wanted could wait. I can still remember the scent of
          the new foam that went into the booth that Rob had hand-crafted. Rob
          had the most free and available location available; and by free, I
          don't just mean the price. Loud sounds and groups of people with weed
          were three things that were difficult to find a place for. Basically
          being kids, except him, we felt liberation in the new Mirra House
          Studio.
