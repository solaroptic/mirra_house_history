          Rob may have been the closest to a viable version of his sound, but
          <em> no one</em> was there yet. I didn't really want to rap half the
          time and D-Mize and N-Cydout were admittedly still a work-in-progress.
        </p>
        <p>
          At the time, I felt like we were going to have to settle for more of a
          good local sound that made money around central Texas, then hopefully
          reach the whole state; assuming we kept that basic line-up. It was
          looking more and more like we'd have to depend on our personalities to
          over-ride shortcomings of performance. I thought it was possible. We
          seemed to represent a wide portion of Texas: we had city, country, a
          female, the three so-called "races," all in a way that didn't feel
          forced.
        </p>
        <p>
          Phil seemed like he had a lot of creative potential if we could just
          nail who he was. I wanted to get him away from the Cash Money style he
          had incorporated due to years of focusing on that sound. Really, just
          using his own humor but emphasizing his natural sense of
          self-deprecation that he shared with Zero, who he also jammed.
        </p>
        <p>
          Uno may have had more ambitious plans as he seemed to move away from
          rapping towards production etc, as opposed to a focus on delivering a
          clarity that would've taken some time. I believe he went by "The
          Puppet Master" some years later, to me and Phil's amusement.
        </p>
        <p>
          Katrina and Tim each had useful qualities but were both more focused
          on other things at that time in their lives.
        </p>
        <p>
          In the end, it was a group of non-rappers making music mostly in their
          own individual style and throwing that into an inconsistent, but
          impressively original sonic landscape. Each song, however, did have a
          specific focus and styles usually crept closer to merging in a more
          harmonious way.
        </p>
        <p>
          Digging at the roots, there was always an odd paradox hanging over us
          of being frequently unusually authentic while simultaneously playing
          an acting game. I think this was always present and contributed to the
          disolution of the group. It was really me not trying to keep it
          together because I lost faith that the acting could ever fade away
          completely; therefore the distinct styles could never merge into one.
